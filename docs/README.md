# Welcome

Welcome to the LuxJS documentation! These documents will contain API documentation and usage examples to get you up and running in no time!

**Shall we get started?**

-   [Server Programming Docs](./server/README.md)
-   [Client Programming Docs](./client/README.md)

**Basic Q&A**

-   **What is "server" programming in LUXJS?**: Server programming includes writing API servers and doing jobs with the CLI interface.
-   **What is "clint" programming in LUXJS?**: Client programming includes writing a client side application for interacting with the server via a clean and innovative UI/X. (Client programming relies heavily on ReactJS so we recommend you know ReactJS before learning client programming)
