> Build, test, and deploy powerful full-stack applications with support for real-time, rest communication, cross-platform applications, and MORE!

# Why?
**Why did we create LuxJS?**: To make NodeJS full-stack development more productive, faster, and safe! Having too many unknown dependencies isn't the safest thing, especially in large commercial applications. So, we created LuxJS. LuxJS is a full-stack framework, which means you can build the entire application from start to finish, including a client application for mobile and desktop plus a whole website for the application if you would like. The server can also be written from start to finish with just two dependencies. One would be LuxJS itself. The second dependence would be your database client, which isn't required.
